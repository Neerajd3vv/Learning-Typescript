// typescript is a statically typed language , which means that the type of variable is known at compile time and cannot be changed at runtime. Typescript can infer the type of variable from the value assigned to it. 
let a: number = 12;
let b  = "6";
let c: number = 2;

console.log(a / b);
console.log(a * b);
